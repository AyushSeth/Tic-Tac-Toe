# Tic-Tac-Toe
Using c


About the game as you know that the first participant to amke a line passing 3 boxes wins.

I have used the same logic and made the game though it may be very odd programming logic used but yes it the easiest game every one have 
to build for the first game now. Now its your turn to build the game.

Take out your laptop and give it a thought and start programming for the game ,i hope you may able to make a better and efficient code for
the game so please share your code with me also and let other knows too.

Show your creativity and Best Of Luck !
